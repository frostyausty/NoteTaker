# NoteTaker

This application keeps track of notes written by the user.

## Description

I created a back end with express.js to host the NoteTaker application. I used routes to connect the index files to the server, as well as 'get' and 'post' requests to list saved notes and create new notes respectively. I created a function that saves notes entered by the user by adding them to the .json file with their own unique id using 'nanoid' from NPM. 

Delete note functionality coming soon!
